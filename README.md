# Facial Attribute Classification

This is a personal project to improve at building CNNs in PyTorch, as well as understand the dataset and dataloader 
architecture for PyTorch. I attempted to reproduce the network from [this paper](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~emhand/Papers/AAAI2018_SelectiveLearning.pdf).
